  All aboard the Blitzr Bus! In this game, each player is given one card at a time with a question associated with each
  card. If the questions are answered correctly, they can give a pre-specified amount of drinks to other players. If
  answered incorrectly, they must take that same number of drinks themselves! <br> <br> </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 3vw; font-size: 2.5vh; margin-right: 3vw; text-indent: 5vw; color: white; line-height: 1em">
  After all players receive 4 cards,
  the next 8 cards in the deck are placed face down. One at a time, each one is flipped, and if a player has that card,
    they can discard it from their hand and give or take drinks. <br> <br> </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 3vw; font-size: 2.5vh; margin-right: 3vw; text-indent: 5vw; color: white; line-height: 1em">
  After all 8 cards are flipped, the players with
  the most cards remaining in their hand must RIDE THE BUS! To get off the bus, the player(s) must successfully answer
    4 consecutive questions!</p>
